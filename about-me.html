                        I've worked over the last 10 years in a couple different fields, such as working in a kitchen starting as a dishwasher
                    and working my way up to a sous
                    chef in just 2 years! After that I went on to work for <a href="https://www.bozzutos.com/" alt="a link to Bozzuto's website">
                    Bozzuto's Inc</a>, working my way up over the next 6 1/2 years from a Pallet Returns Clerk to a Lead position with a shift of 
                    my own to manage, and then I transferred over to selection where I built pallets of product for customers with consistent high rates.
                    Leaving there I went on to join the <a href="https://hiring.amazon.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6-PBus7S_gIVwejjBx19ewMJEAAYASABEgLUY_D_BwE#/"
                    alt="a link to the Amazon Hiring Page"
                    >Amazon</a> workforce and I'm currently one of the top packers in my building with consistent high rates! Over the years I've acquired multiple
                    different and useful skills such as learning that I'm a hard worker, can handle working in high stress and at times high risk fields,
                    and also learning that I need that challenge in my career, that I can't settle for the mundane. These are some skills that
                    help me excel in my everyday life to my professional one.

                        Much like other people my life hasn't been the easiest, but unlike a lot of people I've learned
                        to dig deep with introspection and look for the faults, review and see if things could've been done
                        differently, and to look for the silver linings in every situation. Doing that it's helped get a better
                        understanding of myself and has helped me become the person I am today and I am proud to say that what I've
                        turned into is someone good, I learn from my mistakes and those of others, even though I am a perfectionist
                        I understand and accepted that mistakes are still bound to happen.
