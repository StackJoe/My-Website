                <h3>My Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    Now I may not have the knowledge to be a successful coder but
                    by the end of the Correlation One program I intend to make my name known in the field. Looking through my website you'll
                    know who I am and what I'm about, for instance I made this page to show that what I know so far is still a pretty good amount
                    compared to what is still yet to come. I'm a 27 year old dude that likes to challenge myself when it comes to learning new stuff, I get stumped from time to time
                    but always manage to get over that hurdle and then go on to excel with that subject.

                <h3>About Me</h3>

                <p>
                    I've worked over the last 10 years in a couple different fields, such as working in a kitchen starting as a dishwasher
                    and working my way up to a sous
                    chef in just 2 years! After that I went on to work for <a href="https://www.bozzutos.com/" alt="a link to Bozzuto's website">
                    Bozzuto's Inc</a>, working my way up over the next 6 1/2 years from a Pallet Returns Clerk to a Lead position with a shift of 
                    my own to manage, and then I transferred over to selection where I built pallets of product for customers with consistent high rates.
                    Leaving there I went on to join the <a href="https://hiring.amazon.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6-PBus7S_gIVwejjBx19ewMJEAAYASABEgLUY_D_BwE#/"
                    alt="a link to the Amazon Hiring Page"
                    >Amazon</a> workforce and I'm currently one of the top packers in my building with consistent high rates! Over the years I've acquired multiple
                    different and useful skills such as learning that I'm a hard worker, can handle working in high stress and at times high risk fields,
                    and also learning that I need that challenge in my career, that I can't settle for the mundane. These are some skills that
                    help me excel in my everyday life to my professional one.

                  <h3>In Summary</h3>
                  <p>I'm excited to see where this career road leads to, the skills I'll obtain and the things I'll
                  make leave me eager to learn more and increase what I can do. So far it's been fun, difficult, but fun when everything comes
                  together into the finished product. I'm glad I decided to take the opportunity that <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/">Correlation One</a>
                  has given and quite honestly I'm not a fan of letting people down. So far I've learned HTML and we're currently learning CSS,
                  while I still feel the need to ask for help I'm confident in my abilities to deliver something great!</p>
